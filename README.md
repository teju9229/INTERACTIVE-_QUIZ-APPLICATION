##DESCRIPTION

The Interactive Quiz Application is a browser-based web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide users with an engaging and educational quiz-taking experience. The interface allows users to register or log in, select quiz domains, and attempt multiple quizzes, each containing a series of questions.

The HTML forms the structure of the application, including the home screen, quiz selection menu, question layout, options, and score summary. It uses semantic tags to maintain readability and accessibility. CSS is applied to create a vibrant, visually appealing UI with colorful buttons, background images, animated transitions, and responsive layouts that adapt smoothly to mobile and desktop screens.

JavaScript powers the core functionality—storing and verifying user login data via localStorage, dynamically loading quiz questions and options, capturing user responses, calculating scores, and providing real-time feedback. It ensures the quiz logic flows smoothly, handles form validations, and displays results at the end of each quiz.

This application is ideal for learning, assessment, or entertainment purposes. It’s fully interactive, easy to customize, and provides a fun and engaging way for users to test their knowledge on various topics in a visually rich environment.
